Validation

  Document validation is done on background while you are editing the document and when you save it,
  the validation errors are displayed in the Problems view and can be removed using the contextual menu element "Clear errors and warnings".
  
  Also every line containing an error will be underlined red and when you put the mouse cursor on the line a hover will display the error message
  
  
  Document validation is done:
  
  * Against associated DTD definition.
  
  * Against associated Schema definition.
  
  * To ensure the document is a well formed XML if no DTD or Schema is defined.
