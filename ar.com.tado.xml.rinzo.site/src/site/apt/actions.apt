** {Class Declaration}

  When the selected text corresponds to an existent class full qualified name, 
  the action Open Declaration will be enable, which opens the source of the selected full qualified class name.

  When the selected text corresponds to a non existent class full qualified name, 
  the action Create Declaration will be enable, making possible the creation of a class 
  with the selected full qualified class name.

** {Clear Errors and Warnings}

  As its name says this action will clean all errors and warnings on a opened document or selected files in the resources tree.

** {DTD and Schema Generation}

  Starting with a xml file it is possible to create a DTD or Schema definition using 
  it as example input with the elements "Generate XSD" and "Generate DTD" in the contextual menu.

** {Escape characters}
 
  This action simply replaces all special characters in tag's attributes and bodies to the escaped
  version of them.

  * A single tag.

** {Clear Definitions Cache}

  This plugin handles automatically the cache of DTD and XSD used to validate files, but in case of a problem
  whith cached elements, this cache can be cleared by going to < Window-Preferences-Rinzo XML > and pressing <<"Clear Cache">> button
  After a cleaning this cache will be refilled by the new elements needed to validate the files opened from that moment.
