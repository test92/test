Introduction

  Rinzo is an Eclipse xml editor with the goal of make life simpler when dealing with xml files.\
  It has several features regarding plain xml edition such as:
  
  * If DTD/Schema is present it'll be used for validation and to propose autocompletion of tags and attributes. 
  
  * If DTD/Schema is not present validation will be only for well formness and autocompletion will be based on 
  elements already written in the document.
  
  * And also templates proposals on either case.
  
  * DTD and Schema generation from an example XML.
  
  * Syntax Coloring.
  
  * Background validation using the document DTD or Schema and well formness.
  
  * DTD and Schema generation from a XML.
 
  * Namespace support.
 
  * XML Refactoring and Quick Assist.
 
  * XPath Viewer.
 
  *{{{actions.html}And more}}

  But since working on Java most probably involve the usage of frameworks such as Spring, MyBatis or Hibernate which rely part of
  their functionality or configuration on XML definitions where the programmer declares classes of its domain to the framework,
  what makes this editor different is its ability to interact with java elements in files like <web.xml>, <.hbm files>, 
  <struts-config.xml>, <spring contexts> or any other XML file where java elements must be handled in order to:
 
  * Open a class definition from declarations in XML files.
 
  * Autocompletion and validation of class names on tag's bodies and attributes.
 
  * Create a java class from a class name written in an XML.

  []
  
  And it's also possible to extend its validation and content assistant contributing to its {{{extendingRinzo.html}extension points}}. 

* Requirements

  * {{{http://eclipse.org/downloads}Eclipse 3.3.X or above}}
  
  * Since this plugin is compiled on java 5, you should start your Eclipse using a {{{http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp}JRE 5 or above}}
